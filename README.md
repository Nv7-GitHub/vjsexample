# VJSExample
An example V JS project!
Useful Files:
- `main.v` - The main program
- `run.sh`: Starts a development server and listens for changes to `main.v`, recompiling when necessary. Perform a hard reload when code is rebuilt.
- `build.sh`: Compiles code to `main.js`

`styles.css` is embedded in `main.js`, so you can simply call `load_styles()` during initialization to set up the styles! The only thing `index.html` does is load `main.js`. 

Look in `main.v` for example code.
